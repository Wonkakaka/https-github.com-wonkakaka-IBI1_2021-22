# First note    25/3/22  I am very sorry but I have to say that due to a problem with my device, I could not connect to vpn on my computer and therefore could not log into GitHub on my computer, so I had to do this assignment on my iPad and due to my unskilled operation, I may have had some problems with the formatting of my assignment which resulted in the program not working and I apologise and take responsibility for my mistake.

# second note    24/3/22  It's interesting!
maybe a little difficult
Sometimes I couldn't understand the instructions.
