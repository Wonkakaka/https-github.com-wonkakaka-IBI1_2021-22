Week 4
1.I created a new website <my username>.github.io based on feedback.
Week 5
1.	I added the step on the XY Boolean variable.
2.	I have also refined and added to my pseudo-code to make it more detailed.
Week 6
1.	Due to a problem with my equipment, an unnecessary indent in the previous code writing caused the code to not work. The code is now working properly after deletions.
2.	I have added the item labels to the box plot.


All in all, one of the things that caused me to lose points in my previous code writing was that I missed some of the content. Another reason was that I did not write the pseudo code in enough detail. I paid extra attention to these two points in the code that followed. I hope I have improved.
